This is a fighter game, themed around the Witcher 3 game, where you choose one character out of four, and you have to fight the remaining characters.

Once you clicked on your character, click on any of the remaining characters to fight against. Press attack to attack your enemy, and keep in mind,
the enemy has a constant base attack, but for the players their attack power gets increased after every turn by their base power. After you attack,
the enemy instantly counter-attacks you.

Every character has HP, so you can win the game by defeating all of your enemies without getting your HP to 0.

  **Date:07/04/18:** *This is still a work in progress, as of now the character selection works, enemy selection works, and attack button functions.*
  _Issues remaining are proper attack/hp reflections, moving onto other enemies, and image-deletion after defeating enemy._
